# Owen [WIP]
A Twitter bot to post daily historical facts happened today.    
The events are retrived from the `calendar` bash command.

There are two versions of this program that work and retreive data from the same place.    
The only difference is in the format of the post that will be tweeted:    
* image
* single or multiple (depending on text length) text
